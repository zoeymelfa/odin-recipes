    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <p>This classic lasagna is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family, and freezes well, too.</p>

    <p>From what I can tell, the secret behind Alton's lasagna is the addition of a little sugar to the sauce and using a bit more cheese than most other recipes.</p>

    <p>There are a few minor tweaks to his original recipe that I found necessary, for example adding a dash of wine vinegar to the sauce and changing the amount of Parmesan cheese.</p>

    <h2>For the meat sauce</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 large bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assembling the Lasagna</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put pasta water on to boil</li>
        <p>Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</p>
        <li>Brown the ground beef</li>
        <p>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.

            Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</p>
        <li>Cook the bell pepper, onions, garlic, add back the beef</li>
        <p>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to skillet (in the photo we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions).

            Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.
            
            Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low and cook for another 5 minutes.</p>
        <li>etc.</li>
    </ol>
